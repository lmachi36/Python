# Python
Using a Tkinter GUI Interface I made a graphic calculator
Using the main window I created 5 frames to develop math operators and a input and equals frame
Once the Tkinter GUI was set up then the methods for the operations were made
The basic operations were implemented to make a basic calculator using the Tkinter GUI interface
There are comments in the code to specifically pick out the important parts of the code
